This is the code repository for [The Insider’s Guide to Arm Cortex-M Development](https://www.packtpub.com/product/the-insiders-guide-to-arm-cortex-m-development/9781803231112), published by Packt.

**Leverage embedded software development tools and examples to become an efficient Cortex-M developer**

## What is this book about?
Cortex-M has been around since 2004, so why a new book now? With new microcontrollers based on the Cortex-M55 and Cortex-M85 being introduced this year, Cortex-M continues to expand. New software concepts, such as standardized software reuse, have emerged alongside new topics including security and machine learning. Development methodologies have also significantly advanced, with more embedded development taking place in the cloud and increased levels of automation. Due to these advances, a single engineer can no longer understand an entire project and requires new skills to be successful.
This book provides a unique view of how to navigate and apply the latest concepts in microcontroller development.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Familiarize yourself with heuristics to identify the right components for your Cortex-M project
* Boot code to efficiently start up a Cortex-M device
* Optimize algorithms with compilers, middleware, and other means
* Get to grips with machine learning frameworks and implementation techniques
* Understand security in the embedded space with solutions like TrustZone and TF-M
* Explore cloud-based development methodologies to increase efficiency

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
$ mkdir ~/raspberry-pi-pico
$ cd ~/raspberry-pi-pico
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/picosetup/master/pico_setup.sh
$ chmod +x pico_setup.sh
$ ./pico_setup.sh

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for practicing engineers and students working with embedded and IoT systems who want to quickly learn how to develop quality software for Arm Cortex-M processors without reading long technical manuals. If you’re looking for a book that explains C or assembly language programming for the purpose of creating a single application or mastering a type of programming such as digital signal processing algorithms, then this book is NOT for you. A basic understanding of embedded hardware and software, along with general C programming skills will assist with understanding the concepts covered in this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
